# Odin Recipes (Archived)

## Overview
This project is a simple **recipe website** built using **HTML and CSS**. It serves as an early learning exercise focused on creating multiple pages, linking between them, and organizing content in a clear structure.

The site displays a main landing page with links to individual recipe pages, each containing details for a specific dish.

This project is now **archived** and is no longer actively maintained. It is preserved as a reference for early progress in learning web development fundamentals.

## Purpose
The goals of this project were to:
- Practice writing **basic HTML structure**
- Learn how to **link between pages**
- Organize files and folders (pages, images, styles)
- Use images and text together meaningfully
- Build a small multi-page website from scratch

This project was completed as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum.
